[# GAN–Diffusion Data Augmentation for Industrial Defect Detection
](https://gan-diffusion-data-augmentation-for-industrial-defect-detectio.streamlit.app)

This project combines **GAN** and **Diffusion models** to generate synthetic defect images for industrial quality inspection under data scarcity and imbalance conditions.

## Features
- Pix2Pix-based conditional image generation  
- Data augmentation with GAN–Diffusion hybrid  
- LFS-enabled large file handling for datasets/models  

## Run Instructions
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
3. Run `train.py` or `generate.py` for image synthesis  

## Dataset & Model
Due to large size, model weights are stored using **Git LFS**.
